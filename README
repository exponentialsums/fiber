Lauder-Wan.jl is the implementation of Lauder and Wan's algorithm computing the Newton polygon of an Artin-Schreier curve over a finite field. 

matrix_comp.jl computes the traces in Section 4 of the above paper. 

As an example, using Lauder-Wan.jl to compute a Newton polygon, we could do the following:

p = 5
a = 1
d = 4

DF_g = Dwork_Framework(p,a, d)

NP_slopes = compute_newton_polygon(DF_g, DF_g.X^d + DF_g.X^2)
println("Slopes = ", NP_slopes)

And this yields the set of (slope, multiplicity):

[[0.25, 1.0], [0.5, 1.0], [0.75, 1.0]],

which is expected as the Hodge polygon.
