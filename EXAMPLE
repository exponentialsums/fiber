As an example, using Lauder-Wan.jl to compute a Newton polygon, 
we could do the following (you would want to put this at the bottom of the
Lauder-Wan.jl file in the "Example" section):

p = 5
a = 1
d = 4

DF_g = Dwork_Framework(p,a, d)

NP_slopes = compute_newton_polygon(DF_g, DF_g.X^d + DF_g.X^2)
println("Slopes = ", NP_slopes)

And this yields the set of (slope, multiplicity):

[[0.25, 1.0], [0.5, 1.0], [0.75, 1.0]],

which is expected as the Hodge polygon. If images of the NP are desired, the
function test_poly may be used instead:

test_poly(DF_g, DF_g.X^d + DF_g.X^2, [DF_g.Fq(1)]),

and this function will compute NP(lambda*f) for each lambda in lambda_set. 
The red line plotted by this function is the Hodge polygon.

NOTE: For each p, a and d, the values of dirty_padic_prec (the p-adic precision)
and dirty_ps_prec (the power series precision) must be manually set. 
If the NP is computed and does not look correct, increase these values until 
the slopes conform to expectations.
